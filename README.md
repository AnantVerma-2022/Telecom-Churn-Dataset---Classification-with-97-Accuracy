Understanding the business problem: Telcom Customer Churn
Defination of Customer Churn:

Customer churn is the percentage of customers that stopped using your company's product or service during a certain time frame. Churn rate can be calculated by dividing the number of customers you lost during that time period --> say a quarter --> by the number of customers you had at the beginning of that time period.

It is also known as customer attrition.
